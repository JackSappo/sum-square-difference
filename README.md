## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## Running unit tests
In this repo, run `npm run test`

## Component Map
```
App
|_UserInput
|_NetworkRequests
  |_NetworkRequest
```

## Additional Considerations
* We might not want to include cached results in the list of network requests. For the purposes of this project, I left it in so that we can watch occurrences increase.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
